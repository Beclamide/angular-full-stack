#### Running the Demo

Install the NPM modules and Bower components by opening a terminal window and running:

`$ npm install`

`$ bower install`

To start the application, run:
`$ grunt serve`

Grunt will watch files for changes and automatically run JSHint on recently edited files, and Karma / E2E tests on the server and client.

To start the tests manually, run:
`$ grunt test`
